# DGABluetoothRobot
An modified version of example code for the RedBear BLE Shield which acts as a simple controller for a robot. 
Arduino code which should be paired with this project is in DGABluetoothRobotArduino.
A major issue we've encountered is Bluetooth Low Energy which is used by the Bluetooth shield has a very small range. For now, development has stopped on this project. We're working on the BumperBotAndroid project which does not use BLE.
This project is still used for reference for its user interface and general bluetooth protocol.
